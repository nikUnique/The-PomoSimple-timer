# The PomoSimple Timer

## What is This App About

Web app in which you can use pomodoro timer, but you also can switch to another mode which is simple timer, because sometimes you don't need the pomodoro timer, but you do need a timer, so this can be quite helpful, because there are no series or cycles unlike pomodoro mode. Basically, this app designed to make it convenient to work or study using pomodoro technique or a simple timer, based on my own experience.

## Stats

There are also statistics in the app, which have 2 pages: history and summary. Both these pages keep the stats for both modes. You also can export the history into csv file format, so you can keep and track your progress without losing it.

## Settings

There are also settings in the app in which you can change some things like what sound to play after the timer finished, volume, you also can choose timer mode and dependent on that you can set time for either one mode or another. There is also possibility to play sound during pause, so that you don't accidentally forget that you paused the timer after you paused it, because I found that this can become a problem during pomodoro sessions.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Some users may prefer keyboard shortcuts over simple mouse, so I included basic shortcuts for opening windows for every part of the app and for controlling the timer.
